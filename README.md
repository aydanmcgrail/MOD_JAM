## Description

In a dark dungeon a frog is trying to clean his room by getting rid of the flies. The frog is afflicted with a curse. If he moves too much, he will turn into stone. He can also transmit his curse to others. Through enough friction by contact, the frog can turn the flies into stones.

> In this game, extend the tongue by repeatedly pressing A. Repeatedly pressing B key will to pull it back. 

> You can change the frog's height with the mouse (mouseY), 

> The frog looses life points progressively when the tongue is extended. The amount of life points lost is tied to the length of the extention.
