I love your project and the different feelings it gives me. I like the wierd maped out face of what I believe to be your own dog. Having mostly been in contact throughout my life with small cute but sometimes derpy small dogs like yours, I feel the relation you have with your dog is similar to the relation I had with my past small dog who we eagerly called Mambo. They might be small but they have that energy and attitude no other dogs can match.

Going to the song, I really enjoy it! It's upbeat, it sets you in the right mood.

Right after, I hear your voice telling me/the dog that I am a good boy. I feel me and that dog are flawless, nothing can stop us. 

I then get this feeling things start to go pretty fast and I am feeling things may be getting out of hand pretty fast. Stress and uncertainty kicks in... My opstimism is then crushed when I loose, music stops and you tell us that they will be no more treats. 

All this to say it was a very fun ride of emotions!

System wise, I would only say that I feel that when things go very fast. The tongue doesn't register with the treats all the time. Maybe that's just fine since it adds the complexity that then creates the stress and the uncertainty I was talking about before. I like that even though the tongue is not extending therefore i am not clicking, I can still get points by moving einstein right in front od the treat.   

Looking at your script.js. I appreciate that you made your code so clear! I love the bracket outline around the differents parts. It's pleasing to the eye and makes your code clear and concise.

Great job!!

I see at the end of your code that you want to add a version for cellphone format. I would be definitely excited to see that!

Awesome job! I am really really impressed by the depth of your project. All the different systems work with each other flawlesly. 

The menu is great! It's all clear and I love that it's all layered to seperate each parameters so we only see them one at a time.  

I think you also struck a great balance with the difficulty. You made the difficulty challenging and stimulating without it being unfair. I appreciate that the flies don't come all at the same time. Otherwise I am sure I would have got overwhelmed. My brain also have to maintain control over the various needs of the frog. I realise I forgot many times to answer the frog and instead aimed for the yellow frogs which is an harder task. I also want to add I always entertain the frog by giving it meaningful answers (i don't answer it with gibberish : dskjfhsfkdskfdsfdsds => ENTER). I think this is all to your benefit because it shows you made a game people are immersed in.  

Maybe adding sound to your project could be a step to make it even more refined and immersive. 

Looking at your code, not only it's clear, it's also very complex. You seem to understand coding very deeply. I feel you are really in control of the system and you can easily choose what is the right code to use. At some point I get lost not because the code is unclear, but because I can't wrap my head around such complexity. And the number of lines, that's mindblowing!!! Forget the sound suggestion, you already outdid yourself!

I even love the text font you used for the game title. I wonder what font it is...

Great job!!

You make me want to be a saint for the rest of my life. There is no chance I am sentenced next to that frog. Hell no! (pun intended).

Anyways, while being very chaotic and exuberant as hell should be, your project is also fun and very funny. I like the meme aspect to your visuals. I also like that you added different species of flies/bugs to eat and that they are each related to one of the three counters.

Although it could have been too busy to add a more complex background when you play since the bugs are so small, I think some hellish landscape at the bottom for example could have have been good. Your intro and outro background are very detailed and charged with images while the middle part where you play the frog as just a fill background. I'm not even sure my suggestion of adding more extra to that background might be good, it might just be too much. Maybe that's just something to try to se if it would fit. 

The way your tongue works is very interesting and intriguing. Not looking at your code, it feels your tongue as a mind of its own as if it's has his own mind. Sometimes I feel it is cursed and doesn't help you and sometimes it's more eager than you to get back out of hell by instantly latching onto the bugs. 

The addition of the zombie outro is chef's kiss. Having played cod zombies when I was younger I can feel that song and what it entails.
It reinforces your idea that even though I won, I am still stuck in hell, superHELL even. You really had me in the first part. I thought I could get out of hell but you deceitfully smashed all my hopes!

Looking at your code I think it is a good idea that you put all your sounds into a const = sounds. It makes things more clear. Pretty big and next-level code you have here. I like your idea of using the whatScreen variable to check what state the game is in. 

Great job!!
